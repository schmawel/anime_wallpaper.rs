# Random anime wallpaper

This is a small tool that selects a random anime from the list in `anime_list.toml`, finds a random wallpaper on `wallhaven.cc`, and sets it as a gnome wallpaper.

It can probably be adapted to set the wallpaper for whatever window manager/DE you're using.

The random wallpaper is saved as `wallpaper.jpg`.
